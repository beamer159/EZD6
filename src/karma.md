# Karma

## Karma, a hero’s way to shrug off bad luck

Heroes often have luck on their side. How many times in stories have you seen a down-and-out hero suddenly turn the tide on gloating enemies. These are awesome moments and karma is the mechanic in this game that represents heroes’ shifting luck.

## How do I get Karma?

3 karma are awarded to each hero at the start of the session. The GM can also award karma for excellent role playing moments but the most common way to acquire karma is through failure. Whenever a hero fails an action roll they gain one karma. It sucks to fail a roll and receiving a karma to use later helps take away the sting of failure and ensures that no matter how bad a player rolls they will bank karma for later. You can only ever get one karma a turn no matter how many rolls you fail.

## How do I use Karma?

Karma can be turned in to improve almost any die roll on a one pip per one karma point basis. If this changes your roll to a success you do the task you were going for and lose karma used. If your roll becomes a 6 in combat follow the crit rule. There is no limit to the total number of karma a player can horde or use in a turn. When you accept karma for a failed roll, you cannot then use the karma gained for that turn’s rolls.

## Is there anything I can’t use Karma on?

Yes, karma cannot be used on magick or miracles. The ebb and flow of magick and the fickleness of the gods prevent bending by karma. More on this later when we talk about magick and miracles. Karma can not be used to modify a 1 but a hero die can.

## Calling on your inner strength: the Hero Die

At the start of the session, each hero gets a Hero Die. This can be burned anytime in the game to re-roll a die. Even if you rolled a 1. Once used the die is discarded but can be reacquired anytime by spending five Karma to retrieve it.
