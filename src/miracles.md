## Heroes with devout inclination can call on miracles

You can ask a favor of your divine patron but the likelihood the deity will directly intervene is small. Roll up to three D6, like a conjurer, but instead of a power level, the roll represents the urgency of your prayer. The hero must equal or beat the aloofness roll of their deity to petition for a miracle. The RR will determine the number of aloofness dice rolled for the request. Example: resurrecting a fallen friend would be a 6D6 difficulty while a “speak to the dead” would be 3D6.

Miracles can only be asked for once per situation and since the gods can be arrogant, no karma may be used. Miracles can not be used to harm another being or cause damage. Don’t forget the hero die can be used to re-roll any single prayer die.

Rolling a 1 will automatically end your chance of a miracle. However, like spellburn for conjurers, **offerings** made to a deity by heroes with the devout inclination will receive a blessing to re-roll all the dice for a prayer once per day. The RR will stipulate whether the offering is sufficient to the request.

## Calling on miracles and the Rabble Rouser

Deities play their own games and rarely turn their eye on mortals. This means miracles will rarely happen even with their most devout followers.

When you ask your god for a miracle, clearly explain what you intend so the RR can decide on the number of aloofness dice to roll as resistance to the prayer or even if your deity would grant such a miracle.

The RR judgment is final. Remember that the gods will only ever grant one miracle a scene and or situation and will ignore any requests that break this rule.
