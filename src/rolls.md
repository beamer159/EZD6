# Rolls

## The core mechanic

The Player states to the GM what they want their hero to do. The GM will tell the player the number they have to roll on a six sided die to succeed.  For example, if a hero wants to stab an enemy with their blade, the RR asks the hero to roll a 3 or more on the D6. If the player rolls less than a 3, they fail. Otherwise, they succeed and harm the enemy. It is as simple as that.

## Is a task easy or hard?

The GM will decide on the number you must meet or beat for success. The range is between 2-6 as 1 is always a failure. Higher numbers are for harder tasks. For most combat situations you will need to roll a 3 or higher to hit your target and the enemies will need a 3 to hit you. The GM will use lower or higher numbers for special circumstances.

## What about differences between characters?

In many game systems you build heroes with attributes and skills represented by numbers. These systems slow down play because you often need to reference the numbers on your hero sheet or add them to your dice rolls. In EZD6, the stats are replaced by a simple mechanic called a boon.

## Training is a boon

The EZD6 system easily addresses differences in heroes by simply applying an additional die to a roll, or boon, to tasks where the hero may have specific training. So, when rolling for a trained task, roll two dice instead of one and keep the highest result!

This little difference lets players train all kinds of things, to double their chances of success. Rolling to beat a five? It’s a lot easier with two dice than one!

## An exceptionally hard task may incur a bane

Most of the time the difficulty scale is adequate, but sometimes an action is so problematic it requires a bane. Things like fighting in total darkness or doing another task while on fire count as a bane. In this case, the hindered hero rolls two dice instead of one and keeps the lower result. If skilled, but afflicted with a bane, the hero goes back to only rolling one die. Skill cancels the bane out.

## Can I help a fellow adventurer with a task?

Heroes can give up their future action in the turn to help another player. That player rolls a die and treats it like a boon rolled in the check. For example, a conjurer with the magickal mystery boon gets to roll 2D6 when trying to decipher a scroll of lore.

The player assisting the conjurer has the aspect of training with a scribe. The GM rules that the aspect fits with the task and would allow the scribe to roll a die also.

Three die have been rolled for the check and the final number will be the highest of the three.. Since the scribe helped the conjurer this turn remember that the scribe loses their turn action.

## Oh crap, I rolled a one

Rolling a  1 is always a failure and the GM can put that hero in a sticky situation depending on the action happening in the story at that particular time. Did the hero just petition the local lord for aid? Perhaps they inadvertently insult said noble. Did a hero want to swing from a rope? Perhaps the rope breaks and the hero smashes into the enemy like a bowling ball into pins. A hero still has a chance to recover from a failed roll. See ‘hero die’ below.

## Kickass! I rolled a six

Rolling a 6 is always a success. What happens is determined by what is possible for the hero in that setting. Let the player have fun with the success and allow them to narrate a cool outcome for the roll. In combat, rolling a 6 has an added benefit. See the ‘crit rule’.
