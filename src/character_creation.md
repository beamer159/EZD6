# Character Creation

1. Choose a [hero path](hero_paths.md)
	- This will be your role in the party
2. Choose a [species](species.md)
	- The classic fantasy species are represented and give your hero some extra abilities
3. Choose [inclinations](inclinations.md)
	- Useful abilities and powers to further define your hero
	- Choose 3 for humans, 2 for other species
4. Create [aspects](aspects.md)
	- Created by you to round out your hero concept
	- Create 2, can be created during game play
5. If Conjurer, choose a [circle of sorcery](circles_of_sorcery.md)
	- The circle you choose is important and defines the type of spell caster you want to play
6. Choose equipment
	- Your selection of weapons is chosen by you (clear your choice with the RR). Roll for the Rabble Rouser and they will tell you what gear you start with as well as potions or scrolls if you begin with any.  Starting armor is determined by your hero path choice in step one.
