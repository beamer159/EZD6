# Aspects

Aspects are player-created traits and a great way to round out the concept of your Pusher & Shover.

In addition to Hero Paths, inclinations, and species, characters start with two 'aspects'. An aspect is a single-line description that describes a hero's history, physical trait, or mannerisms. Try to avoid statements that overlap with Hero paths or inclinations. Aspects give a hero some background beyond the rules. It is perfectly acceptable to delay picking aspects and insert them into the game as you discover the kind of character you want to be.

Here are some examples:

- Well-known cook
- A lover of some renown
- Fast on your feet
- A collector of trinkets
- Never show emotion
- Champion gladiator
- Perfume collector
- Studied as a scribe
- Brooding and mysterious
- Devastatingly handsome
- Traveled with a troupe as a contortionist
- A highly refined sense of smell
- An eternal optimist
- A light sleeper

## Benefits of aspects besides role playing

Players can use an aspect to gain a boon to a roll that pertains to the aspect. Players then role play or make the case why the aspect is pertinent and the GM makes the final determination.

Note - If playing in an open world or one-shot, players are free to make up names of locations. If playing in an established world consult the GM.
