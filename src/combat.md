# Combat

## Do I have 10,000 Hit Points?

No. Having lots of health points adds too much fussy math. For most characters, it will be 3 strikes and you are out but having to take those strikes is another matter. Enemies can take more or fewer strikes depending on factors in the enemy and monster section.

## How do I recover lost strikes?

Magick and special abilities can help heroes heal strikes, however you can also recover one strike naturally by eating a meal and resting for the night.

## How much damage will my weapons do?

**One hit = one strike of damage.** So, for example, whether you are hit by a club, great sword or dagger, you take one strike off your total. Giant weapons and siege weapons like ballistae inflict two strikes, but each strike can be saved separately. So it is possible to get hit by a large weapon, make one armor save, and still take one strike of damage.

## The Crit Rule

Rolling a 6 in combat is a crit and has the potential to cause more strikes of damage. Continue rolling one die for every consecutive 6 rolled inflict another strike. This is called “confirming the crit”. Karma can also be used to boost rolls to 6s. Keep rolling until either you do not roll a 6 or run out of karma. With enough luck or karma you could kill anything! Beware! Enemies can also inflict crits.

*“I crit multiple times but killed my enemy with the first strike. Do I lose the crit?”*

Confirmed crits permit unused strikes to be carried over to nearby targets. If you are a melee fighter, only opponents next to you can be hit. If you are ranged, you can choose targets within sight.

## This monster is trying to eat me. How can I escape?

There may be times when you want to restrain an enemy that is running away or escape from the jaws of a dragon trying to swallow you. These types of opposed actions are called *contests*. Think of them as one party wanting a certain outcome and the opposing party wants another.

The GM and the hero roll against each other and the higher roll wins the contest. A tied result means both parties are still struggling to get the upper hand. As in most actions, you can use karma on this roll. Attempting any other action while in a contest will incur a bane.

## Armor is a hero’s first line of defense

Armor allows heroes to make an armor save after each strike they take. A successful roll avoids one strike. The hero who was hit takes the strike from any armor save they fail. If you are hit for multiple strikes of damage (like a crit) you get to make the roll for each strike point.

- Villains and enemies do not normally have a save roll feature.
- Remember that karma can be used to boost save rolls.

## Armor won’t save you from everything

Some events can happen that armor will not protect you from. In those cases make a **miraculous save** roll instead of an armor save. Events such as falling, fire, poison, or crushing rocks will require a miraculous save roll and will inflict one strike for every failed roll.

## Caught in a certain death situation

Some dramatic events may cause catastrophic damage to a character and kill a hero outright such as a massive cave-in or a large explosion. Heroes get a miraculous save roll instead of an armor save but only survive with one strike remaining *even if they make the roll*. Role play how you avoided certain death! Once again remember that karma can be used to boost save rolls.
